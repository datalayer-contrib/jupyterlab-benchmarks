# Issue Bootlenecks and Types

A notebook can present one or multiple issue [types](#Issue_Types). Issues are identified based on [user feedbacks](#User_Reports) and are generated by identified [bottlenecks](#Bottlenecks).

## Bottlenecks

The cause of the issues can be located at different places / bootlenecks.

```                        
Browser <--> Client JS <------> API Server Endpoint  <-> Content Service <-> Notebook
  [A]           [B]       [C]                                 [D]

- [A] Browser Rendering
- [B] Client Parsing
- [C] Network Transmission
- [D] Notebook Read + Parsing + Validation + Trust
```

## Issue Types

### Issue Type 1 - Many Cell Editors

- Benchmark to run: `manyOutputs` `longOutput` `50000Errors`

### Issue Type 3 - Many Rich Output

- Bootlenecks: [B] + [D]
- Benchmark to run: `largePlotly`, `manyPlotly`

### Issue Type 4 - Large .ipynb file

- Bootlenecks: [A] + [C] + [D]
