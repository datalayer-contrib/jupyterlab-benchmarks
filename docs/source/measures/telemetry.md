# Jupyter Telemetry

The Jupyter ecosystem develops solutions aroud Telemetry to gather details on the timelines and resources (memory, CPU...) usage:

- Client side: <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-telemetry>
- Server side: <https://github.com/jupyter/telemetry>

Please note that the `Client` and `Server` Telemetry extensions are completely separated and do not collaborate together for now.
